// pane, two, three or a 2x2 grid. The viewer screen and the meshing preview
// are both this. Design: docs/notes/compare-view.md.
//
// It owns the engine while it is open (engine_reset at both ends), so opening
// it is a session-destroying action for GuiApp and nothing else may render
// from the engine meanwhile. GUI thread only.
